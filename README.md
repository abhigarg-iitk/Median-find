# Median-find
Implementation and detailed analysis of algorithm to find median in O(n) and less than 2n comparisons.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given an array of n numbers, find it's median. The number of comparisons used by your algorithm should be strictly less than 2n.
# Report and analysis
The proposed algorithm has been analyzed in detail to find the optimum values of different parameters. Also, it contains practice for a large range of data size and sets.
Obtained data confirmed with the theoretical proofs to a high degree
